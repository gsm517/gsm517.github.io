### World Happiness Report Dashboard
[App Webpage](https://gsm517-world-happiness-dashboard-main-qodabn.streamlit.app/)
[Github Repo](https://github.com/gsm517/World-Happiness-Dashboard)
- Utilising Python libraries such as Pandas, Plotly, and Streamlit, to create an interactive dashboard to visualise information contained within the World Happiness Report dataset.
- Implemented advanced visualisations such as choropleth maps in addition to more typical bar, box, and line charts.

### Holograpghic Video Stream
[Publication](https://doi.org/10.1002/sdtp.15622)
- Facilitated the running of the first live holographic video stream by building the holographic projector,  refactoring code and coordinating team members across multiple time zones. 
- Presented the video stream as a live demo to an audience of over 100 attendees.
- Later published our work as a scientific paper at the SID Display Week conference.

### Maze Navigation Spiking Neural Network
- Researched and implemented spiking neuron models to form a spiking neural network with the purpose of traversing a maze, searching for a target node.
- Created a program which formed a random maze and implemented a spiking neural network in C++ using object-oriented programming. 

### Bird Flocking App
- Created an app using Java which showed birds flying with a random trajectory whilst avoiding obstacles, made with a focus on learning data structures and algorithms.
- Created a GUI which allowed the user to add or remove birds, and set a flocking value which caused an attraction between the birds causing them to fly as a flock.
